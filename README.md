# Timetables
It is in the interest of people using public transport to get to the desired location as quickly as possible. That is the reason they use search engines to search journeys. Most existing search engines are limited to a predetermined area or can only be used with a permanent internet connection, which may limit the user. For this reason, we have designed a customizable application system that allows the user, under certain conditions, to search without the need for an Internet connection. In the thesis we analyse mainly with the ways of finding journeys in timetables. Our solution uses an innovative algorithm that, with its operation and time required to execute a request, deviates significantly from most existing solutions. For the convenience of the user, we have developed a desktop, mobile and web application that provides the user user-friendly interface that can be used to search timetables and display current traffic information.

Detailed analysis of the system can be found in the thesis located in the repository (currently available in Czech language only).
